## Actions

### [`expo/actions/fingerprint`](./fingerprint#readme)

A GitHub Action that checks project fingerprinting for pull requests using [`@expo/fingerprint`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/fingerprint).

### [`expo/actions/repack-app`](./repack-app#readme)

A GitHub Action that repackages apps from fingerprint-compatible builds with new JavaScript bundles and app metadata without rebuilding the entire native project.

### [`expo/actions/repack-app-artifact`](./repack-app-artifact#readme)

A composite GitHub Action that simplifies the fingerprint-based repackaging workflow by combining artifact querying, downloading, repacking, building, uploading, and database updates into a single step.
